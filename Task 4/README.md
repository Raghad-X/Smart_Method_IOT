In this project I have merged the Watson assistant with the speech to text & text to speech services.
You test it by start by running the speech to text file via cmd and start talk (ex: كيف اقدر اقدم,عندكم وظائف)
and the assistant will reply to you in voice.

Tip: 
If arabic letter doesn't appear in your cmd then try changing the code page to UTF-8 by running the following command: chcp 65001
It is gonna back backword (left to right) instead of right to left but this is the best easy solution for the sake of this project.
